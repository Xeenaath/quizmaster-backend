**About this project**

This is a personal backend project currently in progress.
It's part of a full web quiz application I'm building to practice and improve my skills in:

    Spring Boot (REST API design, architecture)

    Data persistence with JPA/Hibernate

    User account creation and authentication

    Consuming external APIs (e.g., for quiz questions)

I'm using this project as a learning sandbox to deepen my understanding of modern backend development.
Throughout this project, I also plan to explore:

    Validation and error handling best practices

    Security (Spring Security, password encryption)

    DTOs and data mapping

    Testing (unit and integration tests with JUnit and Mockito)

    Environment configuration and deployment (e.g., Docker, application.properties)

The goal is to build a clean, scalable backend while progressively adding features and improving code quality.
